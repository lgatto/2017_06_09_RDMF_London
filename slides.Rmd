## About me 

<!-- I consider myself a modern digital scholar, active and at ease with -->
<!-- data and software, open and collaborative development and -->
<!-- dissemination of my research. I might even dare to say that I am -->
<!-- scientifically reasonable successful, with regular scientific -->
<!-- publication and grant acceptance.  -->

## Background

> Research is the by product of researchers getting promoted. -- David Barron

<!-- And that is a problem - how can *we*, early career researchers and -->
<!-- modern digital and data-oriented actors, i.e. the future of research, -->
<!-- drive change and innovation, in particular in the current climate of -->
<!-- ultra-competitiveness and very limited career prospect? -->

### My talk

- Focused on Early Career Researchers (ECRs)
- Proponents of modern and digital scholarship, hungry for
  transparency and openness
- Incentivisation and career paths featuring the incorporation of good
  data/software management and open science/research practices.

## Content: an opinionated view about

- Modern, open, digital scholarship
- The Open Research Pilot Project
- Role of stakeholders in research
- Data and software research outputs

## Modern, open, digital scholarship

- Open data: [FAIR principles](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable
- Open source software
- Open methodologies: material and methods
- Open access: pre-prints, immediate OA, no hybrid publication model
- Open research process: should not be controlled by commercial or
  political entites, guided by phony metrics; let's not repeat the
  errors of the past!
- Peer review: open, pre-publication (see [slides](https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html#))
- Open Eduction

## Modern, open, digital scholarship

But also 

<!-- Not an old man's club -->

- **Inclusive**
- **Respectful**, for example of under represented minorities (see
  [Open science and open science](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/))
- **Transparent**: research outputs, dissemination channels, and research
  processes

## Open or not 

- useful for others (researchers, public, ...) -- a *good* thing;
  altruism
- useful for me (open leads of reproducibility, trust, visibility) --
  selfish
- open is the future of research and scholarship
- career decisions

## Career choices: open or not 

- **Closed**: scooping, perceived quality, risk averse,
  mis-understanding.
- **Open**: demonstrate your strenghts, stand out, show that you can
  tackle current challenges (big data, automation, reproducibility),
  documentation of research (DMP, for example).

There is a gradient in how much one wants (or can afford) to be an
open scientist. Every contribution counts. See
[Open science and open science](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/).


## The [Open Research Pilot Project](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-research/open-research-pilot-project)

With the [Office of Scholarly Communication](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/)
(University of Cambridge) and the
[Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/open-research).

- the support research groups need in order to make all aspects of
  their research open,
- why they want to do this,
- how it benefits them,
- how it improves the research process,
- what barriers there might be that prevent the sharing of their
  research.

## 

In my opinion, barriers to Open Research are not technological, but
rather at **political**, **institutional**, **community** level.

> A critical point that is missing is the academic promotion of open
> research and open researcher, as a way to promote a more rigorous
> and sound research process and tackle the reproducibility
> crisis. What should the incentives be? How to make sure that the
> next generation of academics genuinely value openness and
> transparency as a foundation of rigorous research? -- Laurent Gatto

## Do we want more OS?  Who wants more OS?

An intricate inter-relation between **academics**, **publishers** and
**funders** that drives (or does not) change?

- Traditional **publishers** are part of the problem, not the
  solutions (see catastrophic JISC/Elseveir deal).
- (Many of) the **senior academics** and **managers** (i.e. those in a
  position of power) have vested interests, are mis-informed on open
  science, and have no incentive to change (see JCS committee in
  Cambridge).
  
## Do we want more OS?  Who wants more OS?
  
- **Institutions**: please, do support your ERCs in their efforts to
  promote Open Science, include them in decision making, **listen to
  them** - [DORA](http://www.ascb.org/dora/), pre-prints, OSC.
- **Funders**, do you want to support Open Science? **Do it!** Funders
  are ideally positioned to drive change, support OS and ECR. But, in
  my opinion, too shy.


## Data and software

<!-- I see many commonalities between data and software. In my grant -->
<!-- applications, as a computational scientist, I use the data management -->
<!-- plan as a software management plan. For clarity, it might be useful to -->
<!-- specify data and software management plan though, and provide -->
<!-- guidelines to reviewers and applicants. Yet another apportunity to -->
<!-- include ECRs and promote openness? -->
